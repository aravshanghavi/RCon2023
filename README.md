Contains major and secondary files for controlling of Elephant Robot for ABU Robocon'23, representing my university and RoboManipal.
Used serial, socket modules for communication between 2 RPis, and RPi and Arduino (Rosserial). 
Used a custom controller built in-house for motor actuation and moving around of the robot.
